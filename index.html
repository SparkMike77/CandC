      <p>This is a project to test my ability to build a unified powershell monitor for a variety of technologies.  Additionally I'd going to try to and control for a variety of services from WSUS to specific services.</p>

<p>I expect to make heavy use of PSTools and some c#.</p>

<p>This project is developed exclusively on my own time and systems and is not the property of employers past present or future.  I do grant a free license to any clients actively retaining my services and any employer for the duration of my employment.  This license will terminate at the same time my services as an employee/consultant do barring additional licensing agreement(s).</p>
